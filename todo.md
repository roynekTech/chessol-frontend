1. Add sound for opponent move, capture , checkmate , so user know when to move
2. for betting game , user have 5 seconds to move else we'd deduct points from user and use the point at game end for winner detection and points reduction
3. Issue when build is done. it says "Buffer is not defined"
4. Add the timer increment after each move e.g 5 + 2 (meaning : 2 seconds added to the timer after each move) , consider making this configurable when game owner creates game
