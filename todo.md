1. Add sound for opponent move, capture , checkmate , so user know when to move
2. increase timer for trail when user move
3. for betting game , user have 5 seconds to move else we'd deduct points from user and use the point at game end for winner detection and points reduction
4. Make time user centric instead of general centric, so when game start , white timer starts and then after playing , black timer starts.
